# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

<header>
I will be adding semantic tags and attributes to the Horiseon webpage to make it easier for other developers and readers to understand and meet accessibility standards.

<h1>Changes I made to index.html<h1>

I added alt attributes to every image on the webpage.
I fixed the "Search Engine Optimization" link and now is working. 
I used a footer semantic tag instead of just a div with a class.
I used a header semantic tag instead of just a div with a class.
I added a more meaningful title to the website added more descriptive text.
I added an aside tag to the box on the right of the screen.

<h1>Changes I made to the stylesheet<h1>
I consolidated 9 classes to 3 classes because the attributes were the same. This solves for less repetative attributes in the CSS file.
