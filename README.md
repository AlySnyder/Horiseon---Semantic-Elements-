# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor


I will be adding semantic tags and attributes to the Horiseon webpage to make it easier for other developers and readers to understand and meet accessibility standards.


## Changes I made to index.html

- I added alt attributes to every image on the webpage.
- I fixed the "Search Engine Optimization" link and now is working. 
- I used a footer semantic tag instead of just a div with a class.
- I used a header semantic tag instead of just a div with a class.
- I added a more meaningful title to the website added more descriptive text.
- I added an aside tag to the box on the right of the screen.

## Changes I made to the stylesheet
  
- I consolidated 9 classes to 3 classes because the attributes were the same. This solves for less repetative attributes in the CSS file.
